# Scrape Jobs and Apply

This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of finding and applying for job positions online. The script utilizes a combination of custom-built modules and popular Python libraries to scrape job listings, filter them based on user-defined criteria, and automatically apply to selected jobs using pre-defined user information.

## How It Works

The script operates in two main phases:

1. **Scraping Job Listings**: It first uses a combination of a web browser automation tool, a job site scraping module, and a search engine module to find and scrape job listings. The scraped job information is then saved into a CSV file for further processing.

2. **Applying to Jobs**: After scraping, the script reads the saved job listings and filters out the ones to which the user has not yet applied. It then automatically applies to these jobs using the user's information provided in a JSON file.
